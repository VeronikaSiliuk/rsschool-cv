**About maself:**
I love to learn something new for myself.
I work well in a team, I have a high level of organization and responsibility.
I have worked as an accountant, public procurement specialist, but so far I do not have the programming experience that I hope to gain.

I’m interested in Web Development because this occupation provides endless possibilities for professional growth.
I know, that my ability to learn  will lead me through this path of becoming a Frontend Developer.

**Code example:**
```let list = "4 5 29 54 4 0 -123 666 -64 1 -3 6 -6";```
```let func = (list) => list.split(" ").sort((a,b)=>b-a)[0] + list.split(" ").sort((a,b)=>b-a).slice(-1)[0];```
```console.log(func(list));```

```let arr = ["bla","wekmvever","needle","bntyn","qwd","qfverv","rtbrtb"];```
```function findNeedle (arr){```
```let position = arr.indexOf("needle")```
```return Нашел иголку на позиции ${position}```
```} ;```
```console.log(findNeedle(arr));```
